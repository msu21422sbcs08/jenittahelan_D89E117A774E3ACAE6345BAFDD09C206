1. Problem Statement

Weather conditions affect daily activities, travel plans, and safety. However, many existing weather platforms are either cluttered or lack real-time updates. This project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly, and real-time weather dashboard to help users quickly access weather information for any city.

2. Proposed Solution

The Weather Dashboard Web Application allows users to:

•	Search for a city and get real-time weather updates.

•	View temperature, humidity, and weather conditions at a glance.

•	See a weather icon that visually represents the current condition.

•	Experience a clean and responsive UI for easy navigation.


This solution simplifies weather tracking by fetching live data from OpenWeatherMap API and displaying it in an organized dashboard.




3. Technologies & Tools Considered

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend : Node.js, Express.js

API: OpenWeatherMap API

Tools & Libraries: Fetch API for API calls, GitHub for version control





4. Solution Architecture & Workflow

Architecture Overview:

1. The user enters a city name in the input field.


2. JavaScript captures the input and sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.


3. The API returns real-time weather data in JSON format.


4. The frontend extracts relevant data (temperature, humidity, condition).


5. The webpage updates dynamically to display the information.

5. Feasibility & Challenges

Feasibility:

•	The project is practical and feasible as OpenWeatherMap API provides free access to weather data.

•	The frontend is lightweight, making it accessible on various devices.

•	Implementation is straightforward using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Challenges:

•	API rate limits: If multiple users access it, requests may be restricted.

•	Error handling: Handling invalid city names and API failures is crucial.

•	UI responsiveness: Ensuring the design works well on mobile devices.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Expected Outcome & Impact

•	Users can quickly check the weather without navigating complex platforms.

•	The dashboard will help travelers, outdoor planners, and daily commuters.

•	Real-time updates ensure users always have the latest weather conditions.

•	Can be expanded with future enhancements like a 5-day forecast and user location-based weather.

7. Future Enhancements

•	5-day weather forecast to provide extended weather predictions.

•	Geo-location support to automatically fetch weather for the user's location.

•	Dark mode for better user experience at night.

•	Wind speed & precipitation data for more detailed weather insights
